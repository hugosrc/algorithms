A binary tree is a type of tree, but the main difference between tree and binary tree is that tree arranges data in a structure similar to a tree, in a hierarchical manner, while a binary tree is a type of tree in which a parent node can have a maximum of two child nodes.

The topmost node is the root node. The nodes connect together according to the parent-child relationship. A node that has no child nodes is a leaf node.

### Nomenclature in the Binary Tree

#### Path - Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.</br>

#### Root - The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.</br>

#### Parent - Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.</br>

#### Child - The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.</br>

#### Leaf - The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.</br>

#### Subtree - Subtree represents the descendants of a node.</br>

#### Visiting - Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.</br>

#### Traversing - Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.</br>

#### Levels - Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.</br>

#### Keys - Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.</br>
